# Dangerzone-image

This repository contains the dangerzone container image that is used to perform "document to pixels" conversions. This container is used by [dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks) to securely convert its documents.

## Using the container image

The image is published on a monthly basis on the container registry, alongside their Cosign signatures.
Additionally, nightly and development branches are published under the `dangerzone-testing` namespace.

## What this container provides

This container provides a way to convert documents to pixel buffers, using a secure sandbox.

The security of the sandbox is provided by different layers:

- The container uses [gVisor](/docs/gvisor.md), an application Kernel that provides a strong layer of isolation between running applications and the host operating system. It is written in a memory-safe language (Go) and runs in userspace.
- Additionally, it is expected that this container is run with specific flags and a specific seccomp policy, to unsure that users are not mapped in the container, that no network is available in the container, etc. See the "how to use" section.

We also provide the following guarantees, related to the distribution of the image:

- The container is [signed](/docs/sign-image.md) in an auditable way, using Cosign
- Ultimately, the container is [reproducible](/docs/reproducibility.md), and so one can verify that it can be rebuilt, resulting to the same digests.

## How to use this container?

The recommended way to use this container is via these flags. They require to defined a specific seccomp policy. Seccomp policies is a way to define which system calls are authorized inside the container.

Here is a podman command with the proper flags, and [the gvisor seccomp policy](tests/share/seccomp.gvisor.json).

```bash
podman run \
    --log-driver none \
    --security-opt no-new-privileges \
    --userns nomap \
    --security-opt seccomp=tests/share/seccomp.gvisor.json \
    --cap-drop all \
    --cap-add SYS_CHROOT \
    --security-opt label=type:container_engine_t \
    --network=none \
    -u dangerzone \
    --rm -i ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/v1 \
    /usr/bin/python3 -m dangerzone.conversion.doc_to_pixels
```

### Output Format

The output of the container is streamed to `stdout` in a custom binary format:

1.  **Total Pages**: A 4-byte unsigned integer representing the total number of pages in the converted document.
2.  **For each page**:
    a.  **Page Width**: A 4-byte unsigned integer representing the width of the page in pixels.
    b.  **Page Height**: A 4-byte unsigned integer representing the height of the page in pixels.
    c.  **Pixel Data**: bytes of raw RGB pixel data
        - Length is `width` x `height` x 3 color channels

## dangerzone-insecure-conversion python package

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this unless you are certain about what you are doing.
> Do not use this to convert documents that should be processed safely!

The python code that runs inside the container is packaged under the name "dangerzone-insecure-conversion". It's considered insecure because the intended way to run dangerzone is by using a hardened sandbox, which is provided by dangerzone.

With that being said, there are situations where it's useful to run this code on its own, for instance when adding new file formats.

### Running the tests

```bash
uv pip install -e .
uv run pytest

# Or, if you prefer to run the tests outside the sandbox:
uv run pytest --local

# It's also possible to run tests in parallel if you have multiple cores:
uv run --with pytest-xdist pytest -n 6

# To build the image and run the tests in one command:
uv run pytest --build
```

#### Reference versions

To make sure we generate the same documents given the same input, a reference
version is kept in-source and used to do comparisons when running the tests. In
case they differ, a `diff.html` page will be generated to help see the
differences. You can open it with:

```bash
open tests/_diff_artifacts/diff.html
```

In CI, the same artifacts are uploaded as `pixel-diff` on test failure.
Download the artifact and open `diff.html` locally.

#### Regenerating reference pixel data

When you are sure you want to regenerate these reference versions, do so with:

```bash
uv run pytest --update-pixel-references
```

## Building and reproducing the image

To build, verify, reproduce, or release the Dangerzone container image, use the
`image` script:

```bash
uv run image <subcommand> [OPTIONS]
```

The available subcommands are:

- **`build`** - Build a reproducible container image
- **`verify-attestation`** - Verify SLSA provenance attestation for an image
- **`reproduce`** - Reproduce a container image and verify its digest
- **`release`** - Attest, reproduce, and release a container image

Here are some examples:

```bash
# Build a container image
uv run image build --platform linux/amd64 --debian-archive-date 20260505

# Verify an image's attestation
uv run image verify-attestation --image "ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/v1@sha256:..."

# Reproduce an image and verify its digest
uv run image reproduce --debian-archive-date 20260401 <digest>
# ... or if you don't know the exact date
uv run image reproduce --debian-archive-date autodetect ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/v1@sha256:<digest>

# Attest, reproduce, and release a container image
uv run image release --ghcr-signer-path /path/to/ghcr-signer
```

## Bump the image dependencies

The container image in this repo is bit-for-bit reproducible, which means that
its dependencies are frozen in time. The factors that dictate the versions of
its dependencies are:

* Digest of [base Debian container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian)
* Date of [Debian snapshot archives](https://snapshot.debian.org/)
* Date of [gVisor Debian archives](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/#specific-release)

To bump the dependencies of the image, first update them in
([`Dockerfile.env`](Dockerfile.env)). Then regenerate the Dockerfile with:

```
make Dockerfile
```
